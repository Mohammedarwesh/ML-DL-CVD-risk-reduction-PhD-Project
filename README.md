# ML-DL CVD risk reduction PhD Project
### Background:
The primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Brunei Darussalam is no exception; CVDs were the leading cause of death in 2015. Therefore, CVDs have substantial effects on public health and will eventually impair Brunei's economically productive workforce. In Brunei, the sole recommended technique for assessing CVD risk is the WHO/ISH risk prediction chart, which has not been validated in the local population. During the COVID-19 pandemic, MOH Brunei Darussalam developed the BruHealth mobile application on a digital platform with several essential features that have a significant impact on the general public's health. 

### Methods: 
A Supervised Classification Machine Learning Problem using standard libraries and modules in the Python3 environment and the TensorFlow backend since **an Adaptive AI predictive modelling pipeline of machine learning algorithms** will be developed and validated using open source CVD risk data collated form the literature and then will be tested by local Bruneian CVD risk data and then will be continously updated and adapted with the prospectively populated CVD risk data through BruHealth national mobile application.

### Objectives
1. To develop an Adaptive pipeline of different ML and DL algorithms for predicting the risk of the future CVD events and tested by Brunei-specific CVD risk data.
2. To estimate the accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, positive predictive value (precision), area under the ROC curve (AUC ROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC PR) and F1 score of the developed ML/DL algorithms pipeline.
3. To compare and prioritize the performance of the different ML/DL classifiers used in developing this automated CVD risk calculator using calculated metrics using an internal validation by splitting the data into training and validation dataset and an external testing by local Bruneian CVD risk data.
